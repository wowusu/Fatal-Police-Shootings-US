# Fatal-Police-Shootings-US
In the wake of the recent murder of George Floyd; by a member of the Minneapolis Police Department, attention surrounding police brutality is at an all time high. 

In this investigation I am going to investigate trends over the last few years and provide a statistical and visual analysis of the killings committed by police.

It is worth noting that any correllation or disproportional representation found in this analysis is not indicative of discrimination by the police. This report intends to identify the trends rather than explain them.

For this report I have analysed the data collected by The Washington Post on fatal police shootings. I have also pulled in US census data by state to be used for state by state analysis at a later date.

The libraries used in this analysis were:

Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Numpy
Statsmodels
SK-learn
